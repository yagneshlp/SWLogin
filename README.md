# swlogin

This is an Android app for automation the process of logging into Hostel Wi-Fi. This project involved finding
the GET and POST API for the Log in Portal of SonicWall, an enterprise grade Firewall deployed by
NIT Trichy, and automating the process of logging in, which usually was a highly manual and time
consuming process. The App was ideated, coded, tested and deployed to Google Play store within 72 Hours.
App received 3000+ downloads and highly positive feedback from peers from all over college.


This app is no longer maintained and is non functional as of 01.01.2018 since the wifi login was removed from the Hostel wifi of NITT. 
It was fun while it lasted ;)
